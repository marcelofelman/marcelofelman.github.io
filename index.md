# If I don't reply right away..

Collaboration is without question a fundamental aspect of today's work; but [collaboration overload](https://hbr.org/2016/01/collaborative-overload) is real (I know it's real for me!)

Please consider the following reasons why my answer may be delayed:
- **Work hours**: I might read you, but I believe we should not perpetuate collaborating outside of normal work hours so it's likely I won't reply.
- **Out of office**: similar to the work hours, out of office notices should be respected. 
- **In a meeting**: I believe we should give our undivided attention to meeting participation, or not participate at all.
- **Focused work**: having an open calendar doesn't mean that one is free. This is often overlooked.
- **No Hello**: Please don't just say hello! Learn more about [aka.ms/nohello](https://aka.ms/nohello).

On top of the above reasons, here are a few considerations I consider helpful for better collaboration:
- **Immediate response**: if it doesn't require an immediate response or requires the other person to think/consider/analyze/assess.. it's a strong candidate for e-mail collaboration instead of instant message.
- **Long content or communication**: consider using e-mail instead of instant message.
- **Adding others**: never lose sight e-mail allows to easily add, copy and forward to other recipients.
- **Information already available**: have you checked the intranet (or similar solution) yet?
- **Are you available on..?**: Assume calendars are up to date and use the scheduling assistant instead.
- **Am I the best person for this?**: if you're not sure I am, please don't assume I am.
